## What is ReAppzuku?

**ReAppzuku** is an app for managing background processes on Android. It force-stops unnecessary background apps, freeing up RAM and extending battery life.

---

## Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| **Android** | 6.0 and above. Background restrictions are only available on Android 11+ |
| **Root** or **Shizuku** | One of the two is required for features to work |

### Root vs Shizuku

- **Root** — preferred mode, used automatically if available
- **Shizuku** — a root-free alternative. Installed from the Play Store, requires initial setup via ADB or MIUI/HyperOS developer mode

> The current operating mode is always shown in **Settings → Information → Operating mode**

---

## Background operation setup

For ReAppzuku to run stably and not be killed by the system, you need to configure permissions correctly. The required steps depend on your firmware.

---

### Battery optimization (all firmwares)

The most important step. If not disabled, the system will periodically kill ReAppzuku.

**Settings → Apps → ReAppzuku → Battery → Unrestricted**

Or via the system dialog:
**Settings → Battery → Battery optimization → All apps → ReAppzuku → Don't optimize**

---

### Pinning in Recents (all firmwares)

Open the Recents screen (square button or swipe from the bottom), find the ReAppzuku card, and tap the **lock icon** 🔒. This prevents the app from being unloaded when Recents is cleared.

### How to verify everything is configured correctly

After setup:
1. Enable the **Background service** in ReAppzuku settings
2. Lock the screen for 10–15 minutes
3. Unlock and open ReAppzuku — the service should be active
4. If the service stopped — repeat the steps for your firmware

> 💡 Up-to-date instructions for specific devices can also be found at [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com)

---

## Quick start

1. Install and open ReAppzuku
2. Grant Root access or set up Shizuku
3. The main screen will show a list of active background apps
4. Select apps and tap the **Kill** button — or configure automation

---

## Manual control

Features that work **without the background service**.

### Main screen

- View all active background processes with RAM usage
- Select multiple apps and kill them all at once
- Long-press an app — quickly add it to the whitelist
- Menu (⋮) next to each app — extended actions

### Quick Tiles

Added to the notification shade:

| Tile | Action |
|---|---|
| **Stop app** | Kills the current foreground app |
| **Stop background apps** | Runs Auto-Kill with your whitelist/blacklist settings |

### Widget

A home screen widget — one tap runs Auto-Kill and shows the current RAM state.

### Shortcut

A static shortcut via long-press on the app icon — kills the current foreground app.

---

## Main

The main screen shows a list of all active background apps with real-time RAM usage. At the top — overall stats: number of active apps and current RAM load.

### Toolbar

Three buttons in the top toolbar:

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| 🔍 Search | Filter the list by app name or package |
| 🔽 Sort | Configure the display order |
| ☑️ Select all | Select all apps for Kill in one tap |

### Sorting

The list can be sorted by:
- **Default** — user apps first, then system apps
- **RAM usage: High → Low** — heaviest apps at the top
- **RAM usage: Low → High**
- **Name A → Z** / **Name Z → A** — alphabetical order

You can also toggle visibility of system apps and critical apps.

### App actions

Tapping an app in the list opens a quick actions menu:

- **App info** — opens the standard system app info page
- **App triggers** — detailed analysis of background activity causes (see below)
- **Uninstall** — remove the app from the device (unavailable for system apps)
- **Add to...** — quickly add to one of the lists:
  - Whitelist
  - Blacklist
  - Hidden
  - Background restriction

### App triggers

Triggers is a deep diagnostic tool that analyzes the **real causes** of an app\'s background activity at the system level. Instead of guessing, you see precise technical facts: what is keeping the app alive, how often it wakes up, and whether it has active network connections right now.

Analysis runs across **14 independent factors** using system commands (`dumpsys`, `am`, `cmd package`), parsing their output in real time. Each trigger found is assigned a severity level: 🔴 High, 🟡 Medium, 🟢 Low, or ℹ️ Info.

---

#### What is analyzed

**🔴 Chain Launch**
Identifies who started this process and by what mechanism. Two methods are detected:
- **Direct call** — another app explicitly started this process via a service or activity (`callingPackage` / `clientPackage`). For example: "VK launched RuStore".
- **Broadcast** — the app was started by a broadcast sent from a third-party app. Shows the sender\'s name and the action, e.g. `CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE`. Reveals hidden dependencies between apps that cannot be seen through standard tools.

**🔴 Foreground Service**
Detects active foreground services — those that hold a persistent notification and cannot be killed by the system. Shows the specific service class name within the app.

**🔴 Sticky Service**
Services declared with `START_STICKY` that Android restarts automatically after being killed. This is why some apps come back instantly — Android itself brings them back.

**🔴 Service Bindings**
Identifies which other apps hold an active binder connection to this one. For example, Google Play Services or push notification services may keep the app in memory via binding. Shows a list of "holders" with app names.

**🔴 Boot Receivers**
Checks whether the app is registered for system startup events: `BOOT_COMPLETED` (after full boot) and `LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED` (before the screen is even unlocked). The latter is a sign of particularly aggressive auto-start behavior.

**🔴 Doze Exemption**
Determines whether the app is on the system\'s Doze whitelist. Such apps do not sleep with the device and retain unrestricted access to the network and alarms even at night.

**🔴 WakeLock**
Detects active sleep locks — `PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK` (CPU stays on, screen off) and `FULL_WAKE_LOCK` (screen stays on too). Shows the lock tag and how long it has been held.

**🔴 Network Activity**
Reads `/proc/net/tcp` and `/proc/net/tcp6` directly to find active TCP connections with `ESTABLISHED` status. Also shows total traffic (inbound and outbound) via `dumpsys netstats` — only traffic above 10 KB is reported. An active connection means the app is communicating with a server right now.

**🟡 PendingIntents**
Shows registered pending intents and how many are of each type: Activity, Service, and Broadcast. A PendingIntent means the system can launch the app at any moment — triggered by a notification, alarm, or external event.

**🟡 Job Scheduler (Jobs / WorkManager)**
Checks the `JobScheduler` queue for active and pending jobs belonging to this app. WorkManager tasks, sync jobs, and periodic operations are all registered here — they are what wakes the app on a schedule.

**🟡 Broadcast Receivers**
Lists all system events the app is subscribed to: network changes, charger connection, timezone change, and others. Subscriptions to `BOOT` and `CONNECTIVITY` events are flagged as potentially aggressive.

**🟡 Alarms**
Analyzes active `AlarmManager` alarms: whether any are wakeup alarms (wake the device from sleep), how frequently they fire (under 2 minutes is high severity), and whether exact alarms (`setExact`) are used.

**🟡 App Standby Bucket**
Shows the system\'s priority ranking for the app: `ACTIVE` → `WORKING_SET` → `FREQUENT` → `RARE` → `RESTRICTED` → `NEVER`. The higher the status, the fewer background restrictions the system applies.

**🟢 Battery Stats History**
A historical picture from `dumpsys batterystats`: how many times the app held a wakelock during the session, how many alarm wakeups occurred, and how many jobs and syncs were launched. Complements current data with historical context.

**🟢 Content Providers**
Detects registered data providers. If other apps are accessing the provider, the system keeps the process alive to serve their requests.

**🟢 Sync Adapters**
Identifies sync adapters — the mechanism for periodic server synchronization. Shows the account type and sync interval.

---

### ⚙️ Automation

> ⚠️ All options in this section require the **Background service** to be enabled

#### Background service

The main automation toggle. Starts a persistent background process for ReAppzuku. Without it, periodic Auto-Kill and Auto-Kill on screen lock will not work.

#### Periodic Auto-Kill

Automatically performs Kill (force-stop) of apps on an interval while the background service is running.

#### Auto-Kill interval

| Interval | Description |
|---|---|
| 10 seconds | Maximum aggressive cleanup |
| **18 seconds** | Default |
| 30 seconds | Moderate cleanup |
| 1 minute | Soft cleanup |
| 5 minutes | Minimal intervention |

#### Kill on screen off

Performs Kill (force-stop) at the moment the screen locks. Useful for cleaning up every time you put your phone down.

#### Kill on RAM load

An additional condition — Kill triggers **only if** RAM usage exceeds the selected threshold. Applies to both periodic Kill and screen-off Kill.

| Threshold | Description |
|---|---|
| 75% | Early cleanup |
| **80%** | Default |
| 85–95% | Cleanup only when memory is genuinely low |
| 100% | Only in critical situations |

---

### 🎯 Auto-Kill settings

#### Auto-Kill mode

Determines **which** apps Auto-Kill affects.

**🛡️ Whitelist** — kills all background apps **except** those added to the whitelist. Use this for maximum cleanup.

**🎯 Blacklist (default)** — kills **only** apps from the blacklist. Use this to selectively stop specific apps without touching others.

#### Auto-Kill type
This setting is intended for situations where your firmware conflicts with the app. If you notice strange behavior with your firmware, change the type to 'am kill'.

#### White / Black list

The list of apps for the selected mode. Depending on the mode, one of the two lists is displayed.

---

### 🔧 Additional tools

#### Background restrictions

> Available only on **Android 11+**

Uses Android's system mechanism (`appops`) to **block an app from running in the background at the OS level**. A deeper tool than a regular Kill.

| | Regular Kill | Background restrictions |
|---|---|---|
| How it works | Force-stops the process | Prevents Android from launching the process in the background |
| Can restart | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Persists after reboot | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Requires Android 11+ | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

**Types of restrictions**
- Soft (RUN_ANY_IN_BACKGROUND ignore)\
Blocks the app from auto-starting at a stricter level than standard activity settings.\
**How it works**: If you opened an app and minimized it, it will continue running (while in Recents). But on its own (at night or in the background) it will not wake up until you open it.

- Hard (Soft restriction + START_FOREGROUND ignore + RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED ignore + Removal from battery optimization whitelist)\
Blocks any background activity for the app.\
**How it works**: As soon as you minimize the app or switch to another one, the system immediately "kills" it. It cannot keep itself in memory for a single second without your direct attention (even if it appears in Recents). Be careful with the Hard restriction, as it may completely prevent an app from performing any background operations (downloading files, playing media, long-running internal tasks).

Statuses in the list:
- **Saved in ReAppzuku** — saved, but the status from the system is unknown (no permission)
- **Saved in ReAppzuku, but not applied** — saved, but Android has not applied the restriction
- **Restricted, but not by ReAppzuku** — restricted by Android or another app

> ⚠️ Be careful with system apps — restricting their background activity may break notifications, VPN, widgets, and the keyboard

#### Re-apply background restrictions

Manually re-applies all saved restrictions. After a reboot this happens **automatically** when the background service starts.

#### Restriction Scheduler
Schedule restriction actions for your applications.

> Only apps with an active **Background Restriction** (soft or hard) are shown in the list.
> Already scheduled entries are indicated by a 🕐 icon next to the app, including the scheduled time.

Tap an app to open its scheduler settings:

**Protect from**
Select the restrictions the app will be temporarily protected from.

**Time window**
Set the start time (restrictions lifted) and end time (restrictions restored).
The app will be force-stopped before restrictions are restored.

**On activation**
Action to perform when restrictions are lifted. Available options:

- **None** — no additional actions.
- **Launch component** — opens the app's component picker (Activity, Service, Receiver, etc.).

> Number of available schedule plans is limited to 15 applications for security of ReAppzuku itself.

#### Sleep Mode

Completely **freezes** selected apps when the device is idle. Unlike background restrictions — the app simply cannot start, it is fully disabled by the system.

How it works:
1. Screen turns off → a timer starts
2. Timer expires → selected apps are frozen
3. Screen turns on and is unlocked → apps are unfrozen automatically

> ⚠️ Only works with user apps — system apps cannot be frozen (limitation of modern Android)

> ⚠️ When Sleep Mode is enabled, the app restarts — this is necessary for correct initialization

#### Sleep Mode app list

Choose which apps will be frozen in Sleep Mode.

#### Freeze timer

The inactivity period after which freezing triggers: from **5 to 60 minutes** (default 60 minutes).

#### Clear cache for all apps

Runs the system command `pm trim-caches` — clears the cache of all apps at once.

#### Hidden apps

Apps in this list are not shown in the main list and are never affected by Auto-Kill. Useful for service processes you don't need to see.

#### Backup and restore

Export and import all settings to a JSON file. Saves the whitelist, blacklist, hidden apps, background restrictions, Sleep Mode, and all automation parameters.

## FAQ

**❓ An app restarts immediately after Kill — what should I do?**

Add it to **Background restrictions**. This will prevent Android from restarting it in the background at the system level.

---

**❓ Background restrictions are lost after a reboot**

Enable the **Background service** — when it starts after a reboot, it automatically restores all saved restrictions.

---

**❓ Which mode should I choose — whitelist or blacklist?**

Whitelist — if you want to stop everything except what's important. Blacklist — if you want to stop only specific apps without touching the rest.

---

**❓ Is the background service needed for manual Kill?**

No. Manual Kill from the main screen, quick tiles, widget, and shortcut all work without the background service.

---

**❓ Is it safe to stop system apps?**

No. Stopping or restricting system apps can cause device instability, freezes, lost notifications, and boot loops. ReAppzuku warns you when you attempt to affect system apps.

---

**❓ What is the difference between Sleep Mode and Background restrictions?**

Background restrictions — the app cannot **start** in the background, but remains installed and visible. Sleep Mode — the app is completely **frozen** by the system, as if disabled, until the screen is unlocked.

---

**❓ Shizuku stopped working after a reboot**

Shizuku requires re-activation after every reboot (unless wireless mode is used). Open the Shizuku app and start the service again.
